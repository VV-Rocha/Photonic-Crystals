# Photonic Crystal

## Overview
Photonic-Crystals is a repository for developing numerical algorithms to study photonic crystal structures. In this repository we can find numerical solvers of mathematical models of photonic crystals as well as algorithms to analyse our results. To ease user interaction, each method has an example notebook.

## Features
- **Adimensionalization:** Modular routines to convert between physical and dimensionless units.
- **Potential Field Generation:** Functions to generate spatial potential fields and corresponding Brillouin zones.
- **Extensible Structure:** Organized for scalability, supporting future additions like 2D/3D simulations, experimental data analysis, and advanced topology studies.
